The goal of datavalr is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of datavalr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("oscar-mercado/datavalr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(datavalr)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

```{r}
# Add a new observation with dates out of order
new_observation <- data.frame(
  ID = "New.Mouse",
  Body.Weight.1 = 22.5,
  Date.Body.Weight.1 = "10/12/24",
  Body.Weight.2 = 21.8,
  Date.Body.Weight.2 = "10/5/24", # Out of order
  Body.Weight.3 = 21.0,
  Date.Body.Weight.2.1 = "10/19/24"
)

# Combine the new observation with the existing data
body_weight_data <- rbind(bodyweight, new_observation)

# Print the updated dataset
print(body_weight_data)
```
